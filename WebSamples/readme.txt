This website contains HoloJS sample apps that can be loaded from a website.

Each JSON file contains the definition for scripts required to run an app.
Index.html contains links to these JSON files on the web-ar:// protocol.

There are 2 ways to run HoloJS apps from the web:
1. In your app, run the script using its fully qualified URL. Example: "http://<your_host>/photosphere.json"
2. Install the HoloJsWebViewer app, navigate to http://<your_host>/index.html and click on any of the links. The links are on the web-ar:// protocol, the viewer app activates on the link being clicked and runs the app
